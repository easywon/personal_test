Creating tables in Snowflake requires the the session set to be under timestamp_lzt.
Run "alter session set timestamp_type_mapping = timestamp_ltz;" before creating tables with data type "timestamp".

Multiple transactions can be started and Snowflake variables will pass between each other as long as the connection is the same.

Transactions in Snowflake 
    - Establish connection information
    - Open connection
    - Create IDbCommand ON the connection
    - Create transaction
    - Begin the transaction ON the connection.
    - Set the command's connection and transaction.
